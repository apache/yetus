Coming soon!

As a new top-level project split from another top level Apache project, we
are currently establishing an independent build and release process.  If you would

# Apache Yetus Downloads

The Apache Yetus project publishes a single source artifact per release for all of
our components as well as a convenience artifact of binaries and documentation for immediate use. You
should verify the integrity of these artifacts via [the ASF procedure](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html)
using the [KEYS file for our project](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/yetus/KEYS).

In addition to the artifacts below, we publish convenience artifacts in some
third-party repositories (e.g. Maven Central).
