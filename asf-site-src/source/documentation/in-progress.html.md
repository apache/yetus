# Yetus Precommit

The Yetus Precommit Patch Tester allows projects to codify their patch acceptance criteria and then evaluate incoming contributions prior to review by a committer.

* Take a quick look at [our glossary of terms](precommit-glossary) to ensure you are familiar with the ASF and Maven jargon we'll use as terminology specific to this project.
* For an overview of Yetus' philosophy on testing contributions and how evaluation is performed, see our [overview](precommit-architecture).
* To get started on your project, including an explanation of what we'll expect in a runtime environment and what optional utilities we'll leverage, read through the [basic usage guide](precommit-basic).
* Customize how precommit interacts with your project by choosing amongst [build systems](precommit-buildtools), [bug systems](precommit-bugsystems) and [test formats](precommit-testformats).
* If your project has advanced requirements such as module relationships not expressed in Maven, special profiles, or a need on os-specific prerequisites not managed by Maven then you'll need to use our [advanced usage guide](precommit-advanced).

For a complete guide to the Precommit API, see [the generated API documentation](precommit-apidocs/).

For help with CI tools and automation, see our documentation about [robots](precommit-robots).

# Yetus Release Doc Maker

The Release Documentation Maker allows projects to generate nicely formated Markdown Changelogs and Release Notes based upon JIRA. You can view that
documenation [here](releasedocmaker).

# Yetus Shelldocs

Shelldocs provides generation of html formatted api documentation based on comments on Bash functions. Currently supports documenting API status (public / private) as well as parameters and return values.

See the shelldocs cli help for more information on usage.

```bash
$ ./shelldocs/shelldocs.py --help
Usage: shelldocs.py --skipprnorep --output OUTFILE --input INFILE [--input INFILE ...]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTFILE, --output=OUTFILE
                        file to create
  -i INFILE, --input=INFILE
                        file to read
  --skipprnorep         Skip Private & Not Replaceable
```

You can mark a file to be ignored by shelldocs by adding "SHELLDOC-IGNORE" as a comment in its own line.

# Yetus Audience Annotations

Audience Annotations allows you to use Java Annotations to denote which parts of your Java library is publicly consumable and which parts are reserved for a more restricted use. It also provides doclets and examples for generating javadocs limited by audience.
You can refer the user documentation [here](interface-classification) and the javadocs [here](audience-annotations-apidocs/).
