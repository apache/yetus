# Introduction

Apache Yetus a plug-in built for Apache Maven and compatible build tools.  This plug-in offers an easy way to integrate some of Apache Yetus' functionality in addition to offering a way to get some additional functionality that is missing from the base Maven environment.

    NOTE: This functionality should be considered experimental. Defaults, in particular, are likely to change in future revisions.

# File Utility Goals

As part of building Apache Yetus, we needed some portable functionality that we couldn't find elsewhere.  Just so others don't have to re-invent the wheel, we offer these goals as part of the plug-in:

## bin4libs

Apache Yetus builds wrappers in `bin/` that point to executables in `lib/`.  This goal provides a way to do this generically, including providing the capability to put a license file in the wrapper.

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.yetus</groupId>
        <artifactId>yetus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>bins4libs</id>
            <phase>prepare-package</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>bin4libs</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <libdir>lib/shelldocs</libdir>
              <basedir>${project.build.directory}/dist/</basedir>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>

This example will take all the files located in `${project.build.directory}/dist/lib/shelldocs/` and create wrappers in `${project.build.directory}/dist/bin` with any extensions stripped off.  If the `${project.build.directory}/dist/lib/shelldocs/` contains the file `shelldocs.py`, then the `bin/shelldocs` wrapper will look like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
[LICENSE TEXT]
exec "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE-0}")/../lib/shelldocs/shelldocs.py" "$@"
```

The wrapper as written above makes sure that nearly all forms of referencing (relative, absolute, bash -x, etc.) locates the real executable, passing along any options.

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `basedir` | parent dir of `bindir` and `lib` to create relative paths | `${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}` |
| `bindir` | where to create wrapper | `bin` |
| `encoding` | encoding to use when reading license files | `${project.build.sourceEncoding}` |
| `goal` | the goal to use when creating the wrappers | `package` |
| `lib` | where the actual executable is located | `lib` |
| `license` | the license to put into the wrapper. See below. | `ASL20` |
| `wrapper` | the bash wrapper to actually use | `exec "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE-0}")/../"` |

### Licenses

The `license` field translates to `licenses/NAME.txt` as the name of the file to load from the CLASSPATH.  The `ASL20` license is the Apache Software License v2.0.

If no license is wanted, then set `license` to the string `none`.

## symlink

Since Java 7, there has been a portable way to build symlinks.  Unfortunately, standard plug-ins like the `maven-antrun-plugin` have not been updated to include the symlink task. The `yetus-maven-plugin` now exposes this functionality via the `symlink` goal:

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.yetus</groupId>
        <artifactId>yetus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>exec-id</id>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>symlink</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <basedir>${project.build.directory}</basedir>
              <target>existing-file-or-dir</target>
              <newLink>link-to-create</newLink>
              <ignoreExist>true</ignoreExist>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </plugin>

Available configuration options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `basedir` | where to create the symlink, if `newLink` is not absolute | `${project.build.directory}` |
| `goal` | the goal to use when to create the symlink | `package` |
| `ignoreExist` | a boolean that determines whether the goal should fail if the `newLink` already exists. | `true`. |
| `target` | the file or directory to link to | none |
| `newLink` | the symlink to create | none |

## parallel-mkdirs

Maven surefire (as of at least 2.x and earlier versions) has calculations to determine the number of tests to run in parallel.  However, the result is not shared in a way that allows creating directory structures before execution.  For specific build flows, this is problematic.

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.yetus</groupId>
        <artifactId>yetus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>parallel-mkdirs</id>
            <phase>compile</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>parallel-mkdirs</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <buildDir>${project.build.directory}/test-dir</buildDir>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </plugin>

Available configuration options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `buildDir` | where to create the directories | `${project.build.directory}/test-dir` |
| `forkCount` | the number of directories to create| see blow |
| `goal` | the goal to use to create the directories | `generate-test-resources` |

By default, `forkCount` is inherited from surefire and therefore follows the same rules as described in its [documentation](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html).  Of special note is that 'C' (aka core) values are honored.

# releasedocmaker

This goal runs releasedocmaker without the need to download or build an Apache Yetus tarball.  Instead, yetus-maven-plugin contains all the necessary components in a native maven way!

      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.yetus</groupId>
        <artifactId>yetus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>rdm</id>
            <phase>pre-site</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>releaseodcmaker</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <projects>
                <project>HADOOP</project>
                <project>HDFS</project>
                <project>MAPRED</project>
                <project>YARN</project>
              </projects>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </plugin>



The configuration options generally map 1:1 to the `releasedocmaker` executable's options.  Unless otherwise specified, defaults are set by the actual executable.

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `baseUrl` | --baseurl | |
| `dirversions` | boolean; same as --dirversions | false |
| `fileversions` | boolean; same as --fileversions | false |
| `incompatibleLabel` | --incompatiblelabel | |
| `index` | boolean; --index | false  |
| `license` | boolean; --license | false |
| `lint` | boolean; --lint | false |
| `outputDir` | --outputdir | `${project.build.directory}/generated-site/markdown` |
| `projects` | ArrayList; --projects | `${project.name}` |
| `projectTitle` | --projecttitle | |
| `range` | boolean; --range | false |
| `skipcredits` | boolean; --skipcredits | false |
| `sortorder` | --sortorder | older |
| `sorttype` | --sorttype | resolutiondate |
| `useToday` | --usetoday | false |
| `versions` | ArrayList; --versions | `${project.version}` |
