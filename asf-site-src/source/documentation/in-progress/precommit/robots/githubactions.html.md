# Robots: GitHub Actions

GitHub Action support is available in two different ways.  There are some settings common to both:

* Annotations will be used to mark problems in the files for those plug-ins that support this feature and
if `--linecomments` has `github` as a configured bug system (the default).
* Statuses will be added if the GitHub Token gives permission.

## Workflow Action

The Apache Yetus community makes available a built-in action that may be executed as part of a
standard GitHub Action workflow. The basic workflow file should look like this, changing [VERSION] to
either be a released version (or `main` to use the bleeding edge, untested, and potentially unstable release):

```yaml
---
name: Apache Yetus

on: [push, pull_request]  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          path: src
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Apache Yetus test-patch
        uses: apache/yetus-test-patch-action@[VERSION]
        with:
          basedir: ./src
          patchdir: ./out
          buildtool: nobuild
          githubtoken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Artifact output
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: apacheyetuspatchdir
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/out
```

Currently, not all arguments and parameters that can be set on the `test-patch` command line are available to set via the workflow action.
Options currently supported are:

| Option  |        Notes                 | Default | More Information |

| basedir | same as `--basedir`          | NONE    | [Usage Introduction](../../usage-intro) |

| testsfilter | same as `--tests-filter`  | '' | [Usage Introduction](../../usage-intro) |

Items marked NONE *MUST* be provided in the workflow yaml file.

Some options are hard-coded to make `test-patch` easier to use:

| Argument | Value | More Information |
|:--------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| `--brief-report-file` | patchdir/brief.txt | [briefreport plug-in](../../plugins/briefreport) |
| `--console-report-file` | patchdir/console.txt | [QBT](../../qbt) |
| `--html-report-file` | patchdir/report.html | [htmlout plug-in](../../plugins/htmlout) |
| `--ignore-unknown-options` | true | [Usage Introduction](../../usage-intro) |
| `--junit-report-xml` | patchdir/junit-report.xml | [junit plug-in](../../plugins/junit-bugsystem) |
| `--pylint-requirements` | true | [pylint plug-in](../../plugins/pylint) |
| `--report-unknown-options` | false | [Usage Introduction](../../usage-intro) |

## Manual Configuration

Manual configuration is recommended if one needs significant customization over the test environment and `test-patch` flags.

TRIGGER: ${GITHUB_ACTIONS}=True

GitHub Actions support has only been tested on the ubuntu-latest image. It automatically configures `--patch-dir` to be `${GITHUB_WORKSAPCE}/yetus` if not previously set.
