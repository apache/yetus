# Robots: Jenkins

TRIGGER: ${JENKINS_URL}=(anything)  ,  ${EXECUTOR_NUMBER}=(anything)

Jenkins is extremely open-ended and, given multiple executors, does not run workflows in isolation.  As a result, many more configuration options generally need to be configured as it is not safe or may be surprising to users for test-patch to auto-determine some settings.  By default, Jenkins will trigger a full build.

There is some support for a few well known environment variables:

* `${CHANGE_URL}` or `${ghprbPullLink}` will set the patch location as well as trigger some extra handling if 'github' or 'gitlab' appear in the string.
* `${GIT_URL}` will trigger the same extra handling if 'github' or 'gitlab' appear in the string.
* If `${ghprbPullId}` is set, then test-patch will configure itself for a Github-style PR.

To use the pre-built Apache Yetus Docker image from docker hub as the build environment, use the following snippet in the `Jenkinsfile`, substituting the tag for the version of Apache Yetus that should be used and replacing the JAVA_HOME with the appropriate version as bundled mentioned in the Dockerfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent {
    docker {
      image 'apache/yetus:0.9.0'
      args '-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
    }
  }

  environment {
    JAVA_HOME = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64'
  }

}

```

Experience has shown that certain Jenkins + Java + OS combinations have problems sending signals to child processes.  In the case of Apache Yetus, this may result in aborted or workflows that timeout not being properly killed.  `test-patch` will write two files in the patch directory that may be helpful to combat this situation if it applies to your particular configuration.  `pidfile.txt` contains the main `test-patch` process id and `cidfile.txt` contains the docker container id.  These will not be present on a successful exit.  In Pipeline code, it should look something similar to this:

 ```groovy
    post {
      cleanup() {
        script {
          sh '''
            if [ -f "${env.PATCH_DIR}/pidfile.txt" ]; then
              kill `cat "${env.PATCH_DIR}/pidfile.txt"` || true
              sleep 5
            fi
            if [ -f "${env.PATCH_DIR}/cidfile.txt" ]; then
              docker kill `cat "${env.PATCH_DIR}/cidfile.txt"` || true
              sleep 5
            fi
            '''
            ...
            deletedir()
        }
      }
    }
 ```

## GitHub Token Support

Using the Jenkins Credential system, one can provide a specific personal access token
to use with GitHub.  However, it is recommended that Jenkins be configured to act as
a GitHub application as per the
[Cloudbees documentation](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-platform/latest/github-app-auth)
for the optimal `test-patch` experience.  Configure up to the "Configuring the GitHub Organization" and then, using the Jenkins credential system, pass the GitHub App's token to `test-patch`. For example:

```groovy
...
        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'github-app',
                         passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN',
                         usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_USER')]) {
...

        sh '''test-patch --github-token="${GITHUB_TOKEN}" (other options)'''
...
```

Doing so will enable in many circumstances a bit more functionality, such as GitHub Statuses.

## Enabling GitHub Status Recovery

If the Apache Yetus section of your job typically runs longer than 1 hour and you use GitHub as the primary bugsystem,
it is recommend to use the `github-status-recovery` utility in the `post` section of your `Jenkinsfile`. For example:

```groovy
  post {
    always {
      script {
        // Publish status if it was missed
        withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: github-app',
                         passwordVariable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN',
                         usernameVariable: 'GITHUB_USER')]) {
            sh '''github-status-recovery --patch-dir="${PATCH_DIR}"" --github-token="${GITHUB_TOKEN}"'''
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
