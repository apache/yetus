# Name

blanks

# Category

Test

# Description

Provides a test to do two things:

* Fail patches that use tabs instead of spaces (where appropriate)
* End of line blank space

By default, blanks will automatically ignore tabs in Makefiles and Go-related files.  However, if a file is provided, that file must also include the appropriate regexs for Makefiles and Go.

# Environment Variables

None

# Options

| Option | Notes |
|:---------|:------|
| `--blanks-eol-ignore-file=<file>` | File containing regexs of files/dirs to ignore EOL blanks. Defaults to `.yetus/blanks-eol.txt` |
| `--blanks-tabs-ignore-file=<file>` | File containing regexs of files/dirs to ignore tabs. Defaults to `.yetus/blanks-tabs.txt` |
