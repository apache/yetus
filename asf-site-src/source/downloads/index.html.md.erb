Coming soon!

As a new top-level project split from another top level Apache project, we
are currently establishing an independent build and release process.  If you would

# Apache Yetus Downloads

The Apache Yetus project publishes a single source artifact per release for all of
our components as well as a convenience artifact of binaries and documentation for immediate use. You
should verify the integrity of these artifacts via [the ASF procedure](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html)
using the [KEYS file for our project](https://downloads.apache.org/yetus/KEYS).

In addition to the artifacts below, we publish convenience artifacts in some
third-party repositories (e.g. Maven Central) and [Docker Hub](../yetus-docker-image).

# OS X Homebrew/Linuxbrew

The latest version of Apache Yetus is also available via Homebrew on Mac OS X:

```bash
brew tap apache/yetus https://github.com/apache/yetus-homebrew
brew install yetus
```

This will install many of the dependencies needed for the precommit functionality as well.

# Helper Script

To aid in downloading Apache Yetus for continuous integration systems, local build environments, etc, we provide a simple script that may be checked into your local repo [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/yetus/main/yetus-dl.sh). It takes two parameters:

```bash
$ yetus-dl.sh <location> <version>
```

By default, location is `/tmp/yetus` and the version is the latest version. Compatibility is not guaranteed between 'latest' versions.  Additionally, only the last three released versions will be available via this method.

# Previous Releases

The changelogs and release notes for previous releases are available [here](releasenotes).
